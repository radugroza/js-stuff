    // TODO: by using the javascript functions setInterval and / or setTimeout, the following should be implemented:

    // a. on click on "Start animation", the #square div should start moving from left to right, with a speed of 100px / second
    // b. on click on "Pause animation" the #square div should pause its movement, remaining in his current position
    // c. on click on "Start animation" (when being paused) the #square div should continue its movement
    // d. on click on "Reset animation" the #square div should revert to its initial position and stop moving, regardless of its current position
    // e. when the div reaches the right side of the window, it should revert it's moving direction (by going back to the left), and vice-versa when it reaches the left edge
